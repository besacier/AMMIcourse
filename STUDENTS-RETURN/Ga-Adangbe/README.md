# Speech-Recognition-for-the-Ga-Adangbe-Language
This is an Automatic Speech Recognition system for Low Resource Language(Ga-Adangme). Ga-Adangme is a language spoken by natives of Accra, Ghana, with approximately 2million people. Contents of the text were sampled from disparate online sources, including jw.org, and were recorded by myself using the Lig-Aikuma app(https://lig-aikuma.imag.fr/download/). It is a little over 2hrs of audio recordings.
