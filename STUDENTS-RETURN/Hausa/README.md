# AMMI-2020-SPEECH-COURSE
The AMMI 2020 Speech Recognition course was taught by Gabriel Synnaeve, Neil Zeghidour, Emmanuel Dupoux, Laurent Besacier and Morgane Rivera.

The repo contains two major `recordings` in **Hausa language**: 2h read speech and raw speech on Frog Story. They were collected using a mobile app called [lig-aikuma.](https://lig-aikuma.imag.fr/download/) (Source: https://lig-aikuma.imag.fr/download/)
## Part 1: 2h read speech
**_Caveat_**: This record is made up of approximately 2h speech read from text (source: https://github.com/afrisauti/hausa_text_corpus) with long sentences (don't be suprised to find a prompt of up to 7 lines). It is very useful for two categories of people:
* Researchers who truly seek raw speech from very long sentences.
* Researchers who are curious to know the effect of long sentences on their speech or language models.

Despite the fact that short sentences are preferred for raw speech, this long-sentences speech recording is very useful as it has its own role to play in research where testing robustness of models is required. This explains why a recorded prompt could vary from a minute to 5 or 7 minutes. This data is worth appreciating due to its uniqueness and research prospects.
## Part 2: Frog story
This data contains raw speech recorded (in **Hausa language**) by describing events as found in different images that made up the story. (Source: https://lig-aikuma.imag.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/FrogStory.zip)
## Limitations/problems encountered during data collection
* There is possiblity the data contains background noise, like the humming sound of A.C or the soft chatters of flatmates.
* In case my voice sounded sleepy, the recording took place in the middle of the night (I was hoping to find no one awake).
* The recording was done after undergoing a minor dental surgery (in case I sounded funny).
* The recorded language, Hausa, is the language of my region of birth (not my mother-tongue). Apologies to the native Hausa speakers for all incorrectly pronounced words and every injustice to stress patterns.
